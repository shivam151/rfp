        - Flag potential scope creep or missing elements
        - Assess if pricing aligns with component complexity/effort
 
        9. **COMPONENT-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS**:
        For each major component identified in the AI analysis:
        - Pricing reasonableness assessment
        - Value proposition evaluation
        - Risk factors specific to that component
