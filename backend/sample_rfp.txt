1. INTRODUCTION

GlobalTech Industries, Inc. (hereafter "GlobalTech") is seeking proposals from qualified data science vendors to develop and implement an enterprise-grade predictive maintenance solution for our manufacturing facilities worldwide. This document outlines the requirements for the requested solution, submission guidelines, and evaluation criteria.

2. BACKGROUND

GlobalTech is a Fortune 500 multinational corporation with manufacturing operations in 17 countries across North America, Europe, and Asia. Our facilities include over 350 production lines with approximately 15,000 critical equipment assets. Currently, maintenance is performed on a fixed schedule or reactive basis, resulting in unnecessary downtime and increased maintenance costs estimated at $45M annually.

Our IT infrastructure includes:
- SAP ERP system with maintenance records dating back 8 years
- Operational Technology (OT) systems collecting real-time sensor data from equipment
- Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure with data lake storage
- Existing data warehousing solution in Snowflake
- Power BI as the primary business intelligence tool

We have experienced several major equipment failures in the past year, resulting in production delays and significant financial impact. Initial analysis suggests that up to 70% of these failures could have been predicted with appropriate data science solutions.

3. PROJECT OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES
